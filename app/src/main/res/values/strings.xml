    <string name="lbl_who_are_we_title">Who Are We?</string>
    <string name="lbl_who_are_we_text">We are a group of people that enjoys anime and came together to build this platform. We\'ve noticed that most free mobile anime stream platforms sometimes lack quality, have a slow video buffer, or are full of pop ups and really annoying ads. \n\nSo we decided to change that and implement a solution that provides a good experience, for free, with less ads and a decent video quality. Do keep in mind that the episodes featured are not uploaded by us, which makes controlling quality harder.</string>
    <string name="lbl_why_should_you_title">Why should you watch anime on our platform?</string>
    <string name="lbl_why_should_you_text">Our platform does have its flaws, or maybe it\'s missing some of your favorite series, but we will try to listen to the community as much as possible to be able to improve it and provide a better experience! \n\nAs of now we only offer an Android App, but we may expand to other devices IOS, who knows.</string>
